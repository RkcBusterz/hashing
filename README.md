# Hashing Algorithm

## An algorithm, which I wont recommend to use it in your application ðŸ’€.

Hashing is an algorithm which cant be **reversed** unlike encryption which can be reversed by reverse performing the method.

I made this algorithm to learn something new. If you have any way to improve this algorithm then feel free to create an issue. I would appritiate it. Also dont use this algorithm if you are deploying any application because I am not an algorithm expert so some vulnarabilities might come which can lead to break the hashing algorithm and your data will be in risk.
Use well known Hashing methods like SHA-256 and SHA-512 for your application. You can try mine for experimentation.
